SIF-less is a UI Wrapper for Sitecore Installation Framework (SIF).  For those who don't want to mess with parameters and commandline, this is for you.

### How do you use it? ###

* Run SIF-less.exe
* Click "Select a File" to pick a SIF Config File
* Fill in all the fields.  Skipping a field will prevent you from running the script.  Note: Defaults specified in the config are loaded for you.
* Watch the scrolling text and relax

### What should I know? ###
* Run SIF-less in Admin Mode.  You'd do it with powershell, right?
* SIF-less does not prefer 32bit.  It will run, but ensure you have all the IIS SnapIns in place, or you'll see COM issues.
* SIF is required for SIF-less to run.  It's called SIF-less, not SIF-free.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Rob. I'm the owner.  Please feel free to report bugs, fork your own, etc.  Hit me up on Sitecore Community Slack @rob.ahnemann
